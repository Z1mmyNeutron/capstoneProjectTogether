                <p>Our Project is a create a website tailored for students dubbed "The Study Room"</p>
                <p>The website has several subsections: A Pomodoro Alarm setup, A goal tracker, and an ambient music player</p>
                <p>The Pomodoro section is for students who want to use the Pomodoro studying technique to maximize information retention and productivity</p>  
                <p>The goal tracker lets students visualize their progress by writing what tasks they need done and what's been accomplished</p>
                <p>In the ambient music player students can choose from a list of "moods" they want to foster throughout their study session</p>
                <p>If the Pomodoro timer is active the music player will play music during study time and will pause during breaks.</p>
